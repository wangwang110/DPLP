1	there is a new market near my house . 
2	my mother often goes there 
3	and buys what we need for our meals . 
4	but i had never been there before . 
5	yesterday i went to the market with my mother . 
6	there 
7	were so many people 
8	that we could hardly make our way out of the crowds . 
9	there 
10	were all kinds of vegetables , fish and fruit everywhere . 
11	people were talking about the goods and the prices . 
12	the sellers shouts could be heard every now and then . 
13	i remembered 
14	that the day before i had asked mother 
15	to buy some fresh fish . 
16	most of the fish there was frozen , 
17	but we had not much trouble in finding some fresh fish at the other part of the market . 
18	my mother bought something 
19	else as well . 
20	it was my first time 
21	to go to the market , and i was deeply impressed 
22	by what i saw in the market .
