there is an old chinese saying that the moon in the hometown is full .
everytime when i go back to my hometown , i will think of this saying .
indeed , the moon in my hometown is much clear and bigger .
the most important factor is that the sky is not polluted seriously , so i can see the blue sky .
unlike in the cities , the buildings are tall and people 's visions are covered .
what 's more , there are so many factories setting out the gas that pollutes theair .
when i stay in the city , i will miss my hometown , not noly the beautiful scenery , but also the clean moon .
