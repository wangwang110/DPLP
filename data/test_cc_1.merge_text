1	my father is a typical man , 
2	who is not very talkative . 
3	when other fathers say 
4	how much they love their children , my father just keep quiet . 
5	he barely says sweet words to me . 
6	but he will never miss every important moment for me , like the performance in school . 
7	he is always one of the audience and watch my performance . 
8	my father tells me 
9	to study with passion 
10	and he sets the good example for me , 
11	because he loves his work . 
12	sometimes he shows me his design of work , and i admire him . 
13	i know my father loves me so much . 
14	though he does n't talk much , he will be right by my side whenever i need him .
