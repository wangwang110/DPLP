my father is a typical man , who is not very talkative .
when other fathers say how much they love their children , my father just keep quiet .
he barely says sweet words to me .
but he will never miss every important moment for me , like the performance in school .
he is always one of the audience and watch my performance .
my father tells me to study with passion and he sets the good example for me , because he loves his work .
sometimes he shows me his design of work , and i admire him .
i know my father loves me so much .
though he does n't talk much , he will be right by my side whenever i need him .
