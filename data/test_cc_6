there is a new market near my house .
my mother often goes there and buys what we need for our meals .
but i had never been there before .
yesterday i went to the market with my mother .
there were so many people that we could hardly make our way out of the crowds .
there were all kinds of vegetables , fish and fruit everywhere .
people were talking about the goods and the prices .
the sellers shouts could be heard every now and then .
i remembered that the day before i had asked mother to buy some fresh fish .
most of the fish there was frozen , but we had not much trouble in finding some fresh fish at the other part of the market .
my mother bought something else as well .
it was my first time to go to the market , and i was deeply impressed by what i saw in the market .
