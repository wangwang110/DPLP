1	there is an old chinese saying 
2	that the moon in the hometown is full . 

3	everytime 
4	when i go back 
5	to my hometown , i will think 
6	of this saying . 

7	indeed , the moon in my hometown is much clear and bigger . 

8	the most important factor is that the sky is not polluted seriously , so i can see the blue sky . 

9	unlike in the cities , the buildings are tall and people 's visions are covered . 

10	what 's more , there are so many factories setting out the gas 
11	that pollutes theair . 

12	when i stay in the city , i will miss my hometown , not noly the beautiful scenery , 
13	but also the clean moon .
